## 🧠 About Me

### Hello 👋🏻
I'm **Leandro Pereyra**, a student from **Argentina**.  
Currently, I’m in the **sixth year** of a technical programming school.  
In parallel, I'm also studying **English** at an academy and currently in the **fifth year** of the program — I can speak English as fluently as Spanish.

Although I prefer **back-end development**, I also have strong knowledge of **front-end technologies**.  
I'm very active, curious, and always eager to learn something new.  
I adapt easily to teams and work very well in collaborative environments.
